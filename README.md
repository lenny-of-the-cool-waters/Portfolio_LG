# PERSONAL PORTFOLIO WEBSITE

This project is intended to serve as a professional showcase of my technical skills to prospective employers and business partners. The front end is mainly built using React JS with styling done using CSS. Component based development is utilized not only for code reusability but to allow me to incrementally develop individual features with minimal alteration to existing components.
